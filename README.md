## Introduction

This repository contain the main common codes/scripts for the atmospheric neutrino analysis.  
The folder `users_repo` contains scripts that people have used and saved for future generations.  

## How to start

### HowTo Pandora

* In [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9tFiixJm6HJzYnptZbTODOaIBh2LUuIOQs_1bZshjQ/edit#heading=h.aczyuw2yex2w) you will find useful information on how to start pandora.

* The UK Soft&Ana workshop ([link](https://indico.ph.ed.ac.uk/event/130/timetable/#all.detailed)) is the best for starting.  
Note that this tutorial was created for SBND. But application for DUNE will look the same.  
We all stopped at "Write a LArSoft analyzer". In this particular lessons, you cannot copy and paste the code, so try to type it out but if you need any help, there are materials available here to help you implement it. 

#### Other resourcers

* January 2023 LArSoft/Art tutorial ([link](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/57711/))

* France analysis workshop ([link](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/29662/timetable/#20230418))

### APC Activities

* [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CobHh-KE0DEMoUBn11OSFIwSZOZQ0Rn8gbI9bzDUdxI/edit#) to our activities.
<!-- TODO: Merge the two repos maybe?-->

* In [this](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/pgranger/atmo_gen) repository, you can find instructions to the production and event visualization.

## General rules

1. Please, create a README.md file for each directory in which that is relevant. For example, look the folders `ssh_tips_and_tricks` or `install_larsoft_example`.
2. Your personal codes should be kept into `./personal/{your_name}/`
3. Keep things organized, specially before requesting to merge.
4. Don't be afraid to ask questions about this repo, larsoft, pandora, github, life or video games.
